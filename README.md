## Introduction
This [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) sets up a MariaDB database in Docker container.

[MariaDB GitHub Action](https://github.com/YakkaDev/mariadb-actions) based on the Docker container and is limited by Github Actions, which contains only Linux now. Therefore it does not work in Mac OS and Windows environment.

## Usage

This preset will create the `TEST` database on the MariaDB engine version `10.6.15` with the root password `123123`.
```yml

- uses: YakkaDev/mariadb-action@latest
  with:
    version: '10.6.15'
    database: 'TEST'
    root-pass: '123123'
```

### Advanced
This preset will create the `TEST` database with user `username` and password `userpass` on the MariaDB engine version `10.6.15` and characters set `utf8mb4` with the `random` root password.
